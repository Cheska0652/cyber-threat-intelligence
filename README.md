# Threat Intelligence Portfolio

## ABOUT
This repository contains a curated collection of **Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports** developed as part of my continuous research in cybersecurity. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate **analytical depth, structured intelligence writing, and real-world threat actor understanding**, rather than surface-level summaries.

Each report is written with a professional CTI mindset, focusing on *who the adversary is, why they operate, how they operate, and what defenders should do about it.*

## Scope of Research

The reports in this repository cover:

- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

- Ransomware Groups & Malware Families

- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

- Attribution, motivation, and geopolitical context

- Detection & defensive considerations for blue teams

## Methodology

Each threat intelligence report typically includes:

1. Executive Summary

2. Threat Actor Overview & Attribution

3. Targeting & Victimology

4. TTP Analysis (MITRE ATT&CK aligned)

5. Defensive Recommendations

6. References & Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)

Reports are based on open-source intelligence, analyzed and rewritten in my own words to ensure original analysis and clarity.

## Purpose

This portfolio exists to:

- Demonstrate CTI research and writing capability
- Practice intelligence-style documentation
- Build a public body of work relevant to roles such as:
- Threat Intelligence Analyst
- SOC / Blue Team Analyst
- Malware or Adversary Researcher
- Cybersecurity Consultant (Security & Risk)

Think of this as less “school notes” and more field-ready intelligence briefs.
